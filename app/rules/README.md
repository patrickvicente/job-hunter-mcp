# Rules Directory (MDC Format)

This directory contains rules for automation, fit scoring, reminders, and notifications in MDC (Markdown with Code) format.

## What is MDC?
MDC (Markdown with Code) allows you to define rules in a readable, version-controlled way. Each rule file describes logic for a specific automation or scoring task.

## Example Rule Files
- `fit_scoring.mdc` — Logic for scoring job fit
- `reminder_scheduling.mdc` — Rules for when to send reminders
- `status_transitions.mdc` — Application status change logic
- `notification_triggers.mdc` — When to send notifications

Add or modify rules as your workflow evolves.
