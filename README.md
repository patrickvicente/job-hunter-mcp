# Job Hunter MCP Server

A personal, open source platform to supercharge your job search, with a focus on visa sponsorship, AI-powered fit scoring, and workflow automation. Designed for self-hosting, full control, and now supporting both REST API and Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools for next-gen AI integration.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**Job Hunter MCP** is a backend server and toolkit for job seekers, especially those seeking visa sponsorship (e.g., 482, PR pathways). It leverages AI, automation, and analytics to help you find, track, and apply for jobs more effectively. This project is designed for interoperability and composability, and is listed on [Pulse MCP Servers](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers).

- **Hybrid FastAPI + MCP:** Provides both traditional REST API endpoints and MCP tools for LLM/agent integration.
- **PostgreSQL:** Used for persistent data storage (jobs, applications, etc.).
- **job-data-extractor Chrome Extension:** Maintained as a separate component for 1-click job data capture.
- **Optional Integrations:** Streamlit dashboard and n8n automation workflows are supported but not required.
